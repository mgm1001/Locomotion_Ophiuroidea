# Locomotion_Ophiuroidea
The scripts contain the locomotion analysis of three paramters: "arm angle", "sinuosity" and "slip angle" applied in all five-armed ophiuroids.
It refers to: Goharimanesh, M., St√∂hr, S., Ghassemzadeh, F., Mirshamsi, O., Adriaens, D. Arm kinematics in Ophiuroidea (Echinodermata): an analysis on pattern consistency in arm use across species. (submitted)
